\section{Operators}

    \subsection*{Question}
        Extend your code from Lab D tasks 2 and 3 to include:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The ability to write the \mintinline{cpp}{Grid} to an \mintinline{cpp}{ostream} using the auxiliary \mintinline{cpp}{operator<<}.
            \item The ability to read in the values from an \mintinline{cpp}{istream} into the \mintinline{cpp}{Grid} using the auxiliary \mintinline{cpp}{operator>>}.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection*{Reflection}
        I had already created an overload for the write-out operator for the previous task,
        and the read-in operator just needed to iterate through and read in each element in the grid.
